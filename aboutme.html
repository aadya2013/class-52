Hello! I am Aadya and I am from New Dehli in India.
Currently I am living in Singapore and am 11 year old. 
I am a really sporty person and am a really good swimmer. 
I go to many competitions for swimming and get many medals.
 I have also participated in the Singapore Nationals. 
 I also play Tennis and have won quite a few tournaments. 
 I also am really good at my studies, my best subjects are Math and Coding.
 I go to Singapore American School in short SAS, and am in Fifth Grade right now.
 I even speak Chinese, since I  was living in Hong Kong when I was young.
 In my school I have been in a program called Chinese Immersion for six years (ever since I was in Kindergartden).
